<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

<!-- I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). -->

I recently completed my PhD at Loughborough University, where my research examined how State-regulated family planning policies –the three-child policy in China in my work– shape working women’s career experiences, fertility decisions and everyday life in internet communication and technology (ICT) sector. Drawing on qualitative approaches, my research speaks to broader debates in human resource management, social policy, gender and work, and the sociology of reproduction. 

I am particularly interested in how macro-level events (e.g., public policy, cultural shifts, and social event) contribute to gender (in)equality by influencing organisations, family and individual’s experiences (e.g., right, belief, values, preference and choices). I am currently on the academic job market, seeking lecturer and postdoctoral positions or any other potential research project in areas related to sociology, gender and employment and public policy. **Feel free to reach out to me to explore any potential collaboration opportunities!**

## Teaching

I have teaching experience as a seminar tutor and teaching assistant at Loughborough University, contributing to undergraduate and postgraduate modules in:

## Experience

Before entering academia, I worked in the business sector as a human resource professional. I served as an HR intern at DJI, a drone company, and as a management trainee at Costa. These work experiences have provided me with a solid foundation for understanding the tangible impacts of business environments and public policy, while also offering valuable insights for exploring intersecting topics such as gender, policy, work, and organisational dynamics.
