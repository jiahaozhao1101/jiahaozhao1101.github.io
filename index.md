<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

<!-- I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). -->

I recently completed my PhD at Loughborough University, where my research examined how State-regulated family planning policies –the three-child policy in China in my work– shape working women’s career experiences, fertility decisions and everyday life in internet communication and technology (ICT) sector. Drawing on qualitative approaches, my research speaks to broader debates in human resource management, social policy, gender and work, and the sociology of reproduction. 

I am particularly interested in how macro-level events (e.g., public policy, cultural shifts, and social event) contribute to gender (in)equality by influencing organisations, family and individual’s experiences (e.g., right, belief, values, preference and choices). I am currently on the academic job market, seeking lecturer and postdoctoral positions or any other potential research project in areas related to sociology, gender and employment and public policy. **Feel free to reach out to me to explore any potential collaboration opportunities!**
